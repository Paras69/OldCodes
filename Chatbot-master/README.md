# Chatbot for HUMANOID IIT KANPUR

This Chatbot uses the latest version of the open source project [Chatterbot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot).

To use it proceed as follows:

1. Create [virtual environment](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv) for python3 (recommended).

2. Activate virtual environment.

3. `sudo pip3 install chatterbot`

4. Clone the repository and inside its directory run `python3 chatbot.py`

5. Type messages to chat with the bot.



__Note__: It is being trained for a robot, hence ask only "wise questions" (limited fun though)



Speech recognition feature is still to be added as the input source.
